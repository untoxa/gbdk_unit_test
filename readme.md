# Simple unit test system for GBDK

To add a new test just write some .c file, which contains the

```c
void test() {
}
```

function implementation and also a .json file with the same name, that describes the result of a test. Look at the examples, and make similarly.

GBDK-2020, python3, PIL and BGB is required. Windows only version for now.
